# Zabbix Training Lab

Used to provision an ephemeral lab for Zabbix training on ec2 with amazon linux. This will build a number of single zabbix systems, with a mysql backend.

Ensure you have an aws access key and secret already configured on the shell environment variables, or with the relevant iam role for ec2 instance creation allocated to the instance from which ansible runs.
